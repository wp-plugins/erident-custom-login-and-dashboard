== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it legal to change WordPress Logo and texts? =

Yes. WordPress gives you the permission to change whole login screen and dashboard to yours by using WordPress hooks.

= How can I add my own image to use as Login screen's background? =

Simply upload your image using WordPress uploader and copy the image link from there and paste it in the Custom Login and Dashboard 

Settings page.

= On next update will I lose my previous settings? =
By default you will not lose any of your previous settings. Check the Plugin Un-install Settings.

= I want some custom changes. How can I do that? =
You can edit the plugin's php file through WordPress plugin editor. But once you made an update the changes you made will disappear. So make sure to backup your changes before updating.
